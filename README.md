This is a calculator created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, based on a mockup design.
The calculator uses eventlisters to dynamically udpate the display div that contains the data for the numbers, and using
different operators, will compute the operands. It is also capable of completing chain operations. The hamburger menu in the top left corner,
is expandable to reveal menu items. This project is best viewed in mobile mode.
